# Prototyping: BizWallet

BizWallet addressed the cross-section of difficulty accessing capital to start a business and the lack of knowledge about resources (financial and otherwise) that would be helpful to a small business owner.

We prototyped our first version of the MVP (minimum viable product) where businesses will answer a set of questions to receive information on what they qualify for.

At the end, users are presented with a report culled from our back-end of agency, bank and foundation programs of the incentives and resources that they are eligible to take advantage of.

# Interacting with prototypes

We presented 3 different mockups that varied the user flow and branding.

We wanted to learn if BizWallet's value proposition:

* Solves our user pain points?
* Adds any value to the existing state of things?
* Created a good problem/solution fit?
* Addressed the right audience?
* Presented an appealing user flow?
* Had an engaging/useful/complete user experience?
* Has accessible content?
* Provides all the resources needed?
* Looks good?
* Presents something they will use and recommend?



After incorporating user feedback, we built out our MVP.
