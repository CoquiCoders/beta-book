# Community

One of the most enjoyable parts of our Puerto Rico Code for America Fellowhsip has been interacting with the community through the Code for America Brigade: [Code 4 Puerto Rico](http://code4puertorico.org)

We met the Brigade in February at their kick-off meeting. The nascient group had just formed and begun making plans however from the beginning it was easy to see they were making rapid progress independent of our involvement. All we had to do was show up and share the Code for America love!

# Cultural Shifts

There is one beautiful change in Puerto Rico that our Brigade captain Imanol told us about: as a result of the Brigade's organization in San Juan many communities that operate independently and rarely cross paths had begun to come together. Active participants from the start-up community, the government, the entrepreneurial community, and the greater tech community have come together under the banner of the San Juan brigade.

# Skill Shares

In February, we conducted a skillshare at [Piloto151](http://www.piloto151.com), the coworking space in Old San Juan which hosts all the Tuesday night Brigade meetings.

Clara spoke about Lean Startup Methodologies and her experience in the startup world. Ainsley spoke about Rapid Prototyping with Twitter Bootstrap 3. Max gave an overview of how Git works and how to get started using it.

# Events

We have participated in and helped with several events put on by the Brigade.
