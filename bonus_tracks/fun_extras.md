### Extra things we've had fun with.


* [I Love Puerto Rico](http://www.ilovepuertorico.org/)

We wanted to understand how citizens respond to the question about civic pride and then see if there is a connection to the actions they take in daily life. We also want to gather stories about what creates a unique sense of place here in Puerto Rico.

Yo me quedo en Puerto Rico is live and already hosts more than 90 messages from puertorriqueños that decided to stay in Puerto Rico and what they love about their island.

The app has gotten forked by several of the other fellowship teams. It currently lives online at I Love Puerto Rico, and the codebase can be found on [Github](https://github.com/CoquiCoders/ilovepr)

### **Negocio Local**

A promotion system for local businesses.

The idea for Negocio Local came out of the [Unhackathon for Puerto Rico](http://coquicoders.org/unhackathon-for-puerto-rico-san-francisco-side). Puerto Ricans are a highly consumerist culture, however a movement of supporting local businesses is not yet encouraged mainstream.

We came up with an idea and a design for a sticker that a business owner may put on his or her storefront in order to encourage people to shop inside his or her store instead of Macy's or Sears. We knew that unifying local business under a strong brand would have a big impact. However, we wanted to add a bit of engagement and interaction to the system.

We added a call to action on the sticker, the gist being "Text ___ to (787)443-8833 to find out more". Upon receiving the sticker, the business owner would go on the site, register a short code for their business, and before attaching the sticker to the glass, write the short code in the black line.

She would also have the opportunity to determine what the response will be once someone does text the number. Some business owners may want to simply text a coupon back, while others may want
to provide some history about their business.

When the user texts the number, the system will do a simple calculation of how many businesses the user has texted vs how many are in the system, and the user will get a response something to the effect of "You are 95% Puerto Rican", a simple gamification play.

We also wanted to add some analytics and management for business owners which we sketched out here:

Eventually, the goal would be to provide a local business directory and encourage and empower Puerto Ricans to shop locally.

We have been interviewing various small and local businesses and associations both in Puerto Rico and in Oakland and are still getting feedback on the concept.



* [Humedad San Juan](http://humedadsanjuan.com)

Clara and Ainsley are painfully aware of the humidity on a daily basis because for two ladies with wavy hair - humidity can mean the difference between looking presentable and looking completely disheveled. So - we thought - wouldn’t it be funny if… we gave a reading of the humidity and then showed a corresponding icon of a lady with progressively unruly hair.

* Coqui Song

When we came back from residency, we were inspired to share our experience by writing a song.
