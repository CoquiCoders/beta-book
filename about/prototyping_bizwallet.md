# Prototyping: BizWallet

Biz Wallet addressed the cross-section of difficulty accessing capital to start a business and the lack of knowledge about resources (financial and otherwise) that would be helpful to a small business owner.

We prototyped our first version of the MVP (minimum viable product) where businesses will answer a set of questions to receive information on what they qualify for.

We tested our first mockups.

After filling out a basic questionnaire, users are presented with a report culled from our back-end of agency and foundation programs of the incentives and resources that they are eligible to take advantage of.

After user and business feedback, we built our [MVP](http://biz-finance-123.webflow.com/).
