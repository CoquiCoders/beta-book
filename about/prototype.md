# **Negocio 123**
Is a simple website that displays the requirements and timeframe in the process of opening a business.

Why just a quick win?

In particular the painful, complicated permitting process stood out as a problem area, but that was something we didnâ€™t feel confident we could address. Permitting involves an unknown variable of agency office cultures, people and processes. Multiply that complexity by 78 municipalities and it didn't seem realistic for us to take on in one fellowship year.

The government is working towards a one stop shop approach and they are still in the process of defining roles and responsibilities.
Negocio 123 will provide the content required on each phase of the process.

The team set to defining the following high-level user stories to support in Negocio 123:

1."As an entrepreneur I want a bird eyes view of the process of opening a business so that I can anticipate and understand each step."

2."As an entrepreneur starting a business I want to know what to do first so that I can get started."

3."As an entrepreneur I want to know how much the whole process will cost so that I can anticipate the cost."

Keeping in mind the audience and their pain points, we built the prototype with one goal in mind: Enable the potential small business owner to make informed decisions when considering & preparing for the establishment of their business.

We can't expect to streamline the process of setting up a business by directly modifing the process itself but we can provide assistance to the person moving through the process by augmenting their experience. The prototype can improve the experience by setting expectations on what is needed, how to collect it, what the costs will be, how long each step will take and where to file paperwork.

Now, let's focus on our main challenge and our approach.

# **Biz Wallet**


We prototyped our first version of the MVP (minimum viable product) where businesses will answer a set of questions to receive information on what they qualifi for.
