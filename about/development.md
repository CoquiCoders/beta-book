# Ready, steady, go


**BizWallet's** goal is to make it easier for small business owners to access finance. For us that means helping them with the discovery of programs as well as applying for these resources.

Outside of our project's scope, our priority is to make sure that this fits in and works with the overall Econonic Development agenda for Puerto Rico.

This means incorporating our solution into the government's **one-stop-shop initiative**

We understand that the government is planning to make one place for entrepreneurs to be able to sign on and access their information (**single sign-on**) and then expedite the business permitting process to be only **24 hours**. Then we hope to help them **find resources**, and assist with the **application process**, and then again the government will be responsible for making sure that **incentives are distributed** in a timely manner.
