Biz Walett is a web-based tool to improve awareness of financial resources available to small businesses.
The goal is to make it easier for small business owners to access finance.

Why is it a good opportunity?

1. Fits into the government agenda of the one stop shop

2. Small businesses are the main sector in America providing with the biggest ammount of jobs but they are hit harder and need support.


3. Scalability: every city has financial programs available that are probably misused.


Incorporating recent feedback, the BizWallet prototype has an updated design and is now available in Spanish to address our targeted audience.
