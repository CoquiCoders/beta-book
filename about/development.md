# Aligning with Government Goals

Outside of our project's goals, our priority is to make sure that this fits in and works with the overall Econonic Development agenda for Puerto Rico.

This means incorporating our solution into the government's **one-stop-shop initiative**

We understand that the government is planning to make one place for entrepreneurs to be able to sign on and access their information (**single sign-on**) and then expedite the business permitting process to be only **24 hours**.

With BizWallet, we then help them **find resources**, and assist with the **application process**, and then again the government will be responsible for making sure that **incentives are distributed** in a timely manner.

# Working with Government Partners

We have been lucky to have very strong partnerships with different economic development agencies both in the course of our February research and once we identified our project working with small businesses.

They have helped us by submitting their programs aimed at supporting SMEs in order to populate the results of BizWallet's search. We have been working with CCE, EDB, Banco Popular, and PRIDCO both with the upper levels of leadership as well as the ground-level employees that handle applications for SME support programs.
