# Interacting with prototypes

We performed user testing with small business owners.

We used task elicitation by giving the user a specific task or question:

"When was the last time you searched for information about doing business in Puerto Rico?"

"Walk us through how would you do x in this website?"

We wanted to learn if the value proposition:

Solves the pain points? Adds value? If there is a problem/solution fit?
Addresses the right audience?
Proposes an appealing user flow? If it is engaging, useful, complete?
Has accessible content? Provides with all the resources needed?
Looks good?
Engage the user to be notify when launched?
Is it something they will use and recommend?

User testing results: **Greenlight**: what's next?

Now we had to make decisions with the information we've collected during our second visit to the island.

It felt great to have our first assumptions validated.

And now we  are charting our course forward, moving from customer development to product development as fast as possible to build the MVP and test it back soon.

We know the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) we want to build is a streamline search process that delivers real, customized results of resources available to a given business owner.

But it's hard to hear these stories and not want to fix even more. Once we've streamlined the discovery process, what else can we help with? It feels weird to think about making the first part easy and leave our users facing the same complex application process as usual. The application process itself is very different according to which agency (or municipality) we're dealing with, so it's not a simple next-step feature. And we don't want to try to scope out too much and go down in flames trying to complete a mammoth product.

So our next step is to define what we're going to try to build. That may mean scoping out implementation phases and dividing into "Must-haves" and "Good-to-have."
