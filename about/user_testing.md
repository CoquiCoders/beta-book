# Interacting with prototypes

In April and May we user tested the BizWallet prototypes with small business owners.

We wanted to learn if BizWallet's value proposition:

* Solves our user pain points?
* Adds any value to the existing state of things?
* Created a good problem/solution fit?
* Addressed the right audience?
* Presented an appealing user flow?
* Had an engaging/useful/complete user experience?
* Has accessible content?
* Provides all the resources needed?
* Looks good?
* Presents something they will use and recommend?

From our [x number of] interviews we validated our hypotheses about the issues that BizWallet would address and the users it would serve. We got great feedback and a great reception to the product.

**Many testers were delighted** at the experience and the prospect of having a single place where they could find financial and support resources for their small businesses.

###Yes, and...

We knew the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) we wanted to build is a **streamlined search process that delivers real, customized report of resources available to a given business owner**.

However, in learning about the business owner's journey, **it's hard not to want to fix even more.** It felt wrong to think about making the discovery part easy and leave our users facing the same complex application process as usual.

The features built around streamlining and supporting the application process to the incentives we present is still something we want to be very careful with. We know that trying to take on too much can kill a project and dillute its effectiveness.

However, we really believe this is a necessary aspect of BizWallet and we understand it will take careful research and understanding of a new user persona - the agency employee receiving these applications - in order to design and build this part successfully.
