From our 10 interviews we validated our hypotheses about the issues that BizWallet would address and the users it would serve. We got great feedback and a great reception to the product.

**Many testers were delighted** at the experience and the prospect of having a single place where they could find financial and support resources for their small businesses.

After defining our MVP, we began planning second-level features that support the submission of applications to the various government agencies and banks whose programs we highlight in the app.
