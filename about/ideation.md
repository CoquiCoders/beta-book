# Meeting our User

Working from the user stories we identified in February, the next step was translating these into **opportunities for design.**

The intense research provided us with contextual knowledge but more importantly it gave us enough information to undertstand what was feasible within our fellowship timeframe.



As we honed our problem statement, we developed **user personas** to focus our decision making about the product we would build.
