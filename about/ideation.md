###Main challenges (as told by our users):

###"I could not borrow money from the bank because MY credit was really bad"


###"One of the things I know based on my experience is that you have to be properly capitalized. It means you have to have enough money to start"


###"I didn't have the time to look for incentives and I knew it was going to be all this paperwork to file and I didnt have numbers to back it up."
