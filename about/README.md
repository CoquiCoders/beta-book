###Why We Are Coding for America:

**Max** codes for America because he remembers the experience of his family as immigrants to the United States and what it was like to navigate government services. Now with his coding skills he wants to help make government work better for citizens.

**Clara** codes for America because she wants to expose people in government to new possibilities by showing that institutions and systems are social constructions that can be organized differently.

**Ainsley** codes for America becasue she believes in using design thinking to solve the complex problems governments face in making life better for their citizens.

**Giancarlo** applied to Code for America because he is an Open Data Crusader that believes that innovation and the philosophies of open source technology can again make Puerto Rico a world leader.

###Coqui Origins

We were semi-randomly assigned together to work with the CIO of Puerto Rico within the area of Economic Development. "Semi" because we all chose Puerto Rico as a city/place to work with, but we know many other people did as well so there was a lot of luck involved in our pairing.

During January we got to know each other, learned about our ways of working, absorbed as much as we could to prepare us for February residency and the year ahead, and built a team which we named **Coqui Coders**.

**The coqui is a native species to Puerto Rico** and has been their cultural symbol and national icon. When Puerto Ricans want to express their nationality, they say: *"Soy de aquí como el coquí!"* (I'm from here like the coquí!).

We structured our report trying to answer three main questions:

Why Biz Wallet?
How did we built it?
What is it?
