We were semi-randomly assigned together to work with the CIO of Puerto Rico within the area of Economic Development. Semi because we all chose Puerto Rico as a city/place to work with.

During January we got to know each other, learn about our ways of working, negotiate our strategy and built a team which we named Coqui Coders.

Coqui is the national frog and has been a cultural symbol and national icon of Puerto Rico. When Puerto Ricans want to express their nationality, they say: "Soy de aquí como el coquí" (I'm as Puerto Rican as the coquí).

We structured our report trying to answer three main questions:

Why Biz Wallet?
How did we built it?
What is it?

We divided the presentation into the main phases:
Reserach

Ideation

Protoype

Test

Build
