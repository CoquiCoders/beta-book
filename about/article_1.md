#Understanding the Context of Economic Development


During February we focused on getting some answers to our big challenge: **Economic Development**. We performed interviews, observed and visited different economic development government offices, participated in user testing sessions and immersed ourselves in the culture of Puerto Rico and the existing Economic Development initiatives.

Our goal was to scope the project and learn first hand about people and contexts of use.

###Here's what our February looked like:

##Themes throughout our research:

* There are **more than 50 benefits and incentives** offered by Economic Development agencies **to start or promote a business**. These benefits are managed by different agencies without a interagency system, therefore:

    1. **Users** have a **hard time understanding** the best set of benefits **for their case**.

    2. **Government staff** have a hard time identifying and **delivering** the right set of benefits to the public.


* There was a **lack of performance management and metrics** within agencies. **Lack of accountability.**


* The validation process to check upon new jobs created is conducted by phone, calling each business on a weekly basis to validate if they fulfilled their compromised goal when asking for a benefit.


* Lack of integrated IT platform which causes redundant paperwork.


* There is no clear point of entry for businesses to access services and resources.


###Challenges of perception from within the community:

* Citizens seem not trust their government because there is a legacy that every four years the **new administration starts all over again**.


* There is a **DIY attitude** which makes it hard for governments to engage with the community.


###While we collected all of this research in February, this is the process we used to filter our findings into actionable paths forward:

We went back to San Francisco with two user stories that defined the problem area we wanted to address:

As an **entrepreneur** I donâ€™t know where to start and what **support** is available to me.

As a **successful business owner** I don't know how and where to **expand?**
