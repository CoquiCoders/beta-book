#Coqui Coders
##Team Puerto Rico.
We were semi-randomly (we all chose Puerto Rico as a city/place) assigned together to work with the CIO of Puerto Rico within the area of Economic Development.

During January we got to know each other, learn about our ways of working, negotiate, negotiate and build a team which we named Coqui Coders. Coqui is the national frog and has been a cultural symbol and national icon. When Puerto Ricans want to express their nationality, they say: "Soy de aquí como el coquí" (I'm as Puerto Rican as the coquí).

During February we inmersed ourselves deeply into the culture and specifically into the challenge around Economic Development. We researched a lot. Here's how.

The intense research approach provided us with information to go back to San Francisco and start the ideation process. Not only it provided us with findings and opportunities but mainly gave us enough information to undertstand what was feasible within the fellowship timeframe.
