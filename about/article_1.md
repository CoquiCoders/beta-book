#Understanding the problem


During February we focus on getting some answers to our big challenge around Economic Development. We have been performing lots of interviews, making observations and visiting the government offices, participating in user testing sessions and immersing ourselves in the culture.
Our goal was to scope the project and learn first hand about people and contexts of use.

Here's what we did.

Let's get more detailed:

Findings/research:

More than 50 benefits and incentives offered by Economic Development agencies to start or promote a business.

These benefits are managed by different agencies without a interagency system, therefore:

a. Users have a hard time understanding the best set of benefits for their case.

b. Government staff have a hard time identifying and delivering the right set of benefits to the public.

Lack of performance management and metrics within agencies. Lack of accountability.

The validation process to check upon new jobs created is conducted by phone, calling each business on a weekly basis to validate if they fulfilled their compromised goal when asking for a benefit.

Lack of integrated IT platform which causes redundant paperwork.

Small businesses find it difficult to find and access loans and credits.

There is no clear point of entry for businesses to access services and resources.


Challenges within the community:

Citizens seem not trust their government because there is a legacy that every four years the new administration starts all over again.

There is a DIY attitude which makes it hard for governments to engage with the community.


This is the process we used to define opportunities:
(we can make this a graphic)


1. Collect all of the main observations from each interview, visit, or observation in a google doc with takeaways, folow-up and opportunities.

2. Debrief and analyze each interview individually.

3. Review the findings as a group.

4. Define and prioritize themes and patterns.
a. Accountability & metrics
b. Workforce development
c. Starting/Expanding a business

4. Group discussion on which findings were things we wanted to work on.

5. Define 7 areas of opportunities

6. Voted with the CIO and team, kept three.
