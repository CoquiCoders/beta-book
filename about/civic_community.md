Workshops:

Clara spoke about Lean Startup Methodologies and her experience in the startup world.
Ainsley spoke about Rapid Prototyping with Twitter Bootstrap 3.
Max gave an overview of how git works and how to ‘git’ started.

The group in attendance ranged from developers working for a fully-operational San Juan Startup, designers who are just starting out, teachers at design schools, and several others just looking to get more information about tech and design.

There was a great discussion about the Lean Method and people's experiences with its application, as well as a lot of great knowledge sharing after the formal talks had concluded. It was a really casual evening, but a great occasion for us to get to know and interact with the hacker/design/tech community here in San Juan as well as swap info and links between like minds.
