### Extra things we've had fun with.


* [I Love Puerto Rico](http://www.ilovepuertorico.org/)

We wanted to understand how citizens respond to the question about civic pride and then see if there is a connection to the actions they take in daily life. We also want to gather stories about what creates a unique sense of place here in Puerto Rico.

Yo me quedo en Puerto Rico is live and already hosts more than 90 messages from puertorriqueños that decided to stay in Puerto Rico and what they love about their island.

The app has gotten forked by several of the other fellowship teams. It currently lives online at I Love Puerto Rico, and the codebase can be found on GitHub.


* [Humedad San Juan](http://humedadsanjuan.com)

Clara and Ainsley are painfully aware of the humidity on a daily basis because for two ladies with wavy hair - humidity can mean the difference between looking presentable and looking completely disheveled. So - we thought - wouldn’t it be funny if… we gave a reading of the humidity and then showed a corresponding icon of a lady with progressively unruly hair.
