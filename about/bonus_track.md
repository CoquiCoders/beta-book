### Extra things we've had fun with.


1. [I Love Puerto Rico](http://http://www.ilovepuertorico.org/)

We wanted to understand how citizens respond to the question about civic pride and then see if there is a connection to the actions they take in daily life. We also want to gather stories about what creates a unique sense of place here in Puerto Rico.

Yo me quedo en Puerto Rico is live and already hosts more than 80 messages from puertorrique√±os that decided to stay in Puerto Rico and what they love about their island.

The app has gotten forked by several of the other fellowship teams. It currently lives online at I Love Puerto Rico, and the codebase can be found on GitHub.
