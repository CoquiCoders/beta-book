# What's next:

### BizWallet Goals:
For us, the next steps from this point are to really **get our application into production** and **develop the user persona for the government employee** (and needs around) the second facet of the BizWallet product: the application process.

We need to know in detail about the agency employees that will be receiving these applications and how we can make sure that BizWallet's application presents them with information they will actually want, use, and follow up with the client on.

Our extended to-do list includes:

1. Finish the MVP, test it again and iterate according to feedback.

2. Define a strategy to promote and reach out to audience.

3. Define ownership and sustainability steps.

4. Define main measures of success.
