# The Landscape of Puerto Rico

We arrived to Puerto Rico with some ideas in mind and big of expectations. The first barrier was the **language**. Eventhough mostly every citizen speaks english, the language you hear on the street and the language they use to approach you is mainly spanish.

Second challenge was the **scope of the project**. Economic Development is by default a big challenge and you add complexity if you have these facts in mind:

1. BIG DEBT:
$70 Billion, junk status

2. BRAIN DRAIN:
3.7 million Puerto Ricans in mainland

3. COMPLEX LEGAL SYSTEM:
(Spain / US / PR)

4. COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:
78 municipalities

We spent a big percentage of time to understand the largest context around Econonic Development. Puerto Rico has a lot of agencies working under the umbrella of Economic Development and it was neccesary to understand how each agency worked on an individual level and as an overall structure. It did not take long to understand the disconnection within agencies and the complexity of the situation in terms of roles, responsibilities and technology used.

Something that made it easier is the openess and  willingness of the agencies employees.

Many challenges, no regrets.
