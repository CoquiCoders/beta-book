# **Negocio 123**
Is a simple website that displays the requirements and timeframe in the process of opening a business.

###Why just a quick win?

The complicated permitting process stood out as a huge problem area, but we knew we couldn't solve that in a year. Permitting involves an unknown variable of agency office cultures, people and processes. Multiply that complexity by 78 municipalities and it didn't seem realistic for us to take on in one fellowship year.

We envisioned **Negocio 123** as a static site that will provide the information on each phase of the business permitting process:
* how long it takes
* which agencies are involved for each stage of the process
* how much it will cost
* if it is online or an in-person process

The team set to defining high-level user stories to plan Negocio 123:

**1.**"As an entrepreneur I want a **bird's eye view** of the process of opening a business so that I can anticipate and understand each step."

**2.**"As an entrepreneur starting a business I want to know **what to do first** so that I can get started."

**3.** "As an entrepreneur I want to know **how much the whole process will cost** so that I can anticipate the cost."

We built the prototype with a single main goal: help small business owners make informed decisions when establishing their business.

We can't expect to streamline the process of setting up a business by directly modifing the process itself but the prototype can improve the experience by managing expectations.

Now, let's focus on our main challenge and our approach.
