# New Design

We decided to the layout because it was not telling the right story or engaging the audience.
We decided to try something new and test it during our trip to the island.

This was the old landing page:

We then built a landing page that we liked but was not addressing or engaging the Puertoricans. We received some comments on how it felt like an American business owner in contrast to a Puertorican.

This was the new landing page:

We also received feedback around the story provided in the photo. Businesses commented: "Showcase an aspirational business owner"  We asked for aspirational stories and one that came as top of mind was about Hacienda San Pedro - a local coffee hacienda and coffee shop.

This is what the landing page looked like after incorporating the image of Hacienda San Pedro:

During the trip in August we decided that we wanted to include a business owner in the landing we had built a connection with or that we could even meet before launching. It didn't feel like we could meet with Hacienda San Pedro owner before leaving.
We decided to partner with Brands of Puerto Rico, an ecommerce website that promotes local brands, and they suggested that we included De Hojas, a home-made soap company.

This is our current landing page with De Hojas and we love it.
