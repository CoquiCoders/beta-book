# Kiva Puerto Rico

When we came back from February and start debfriefing we realize there was an opportunity for microloans for small business owners in Puerto Rico.
Why? Many business owners can't access credits from commercial banks because of their collaterals.

For a moment we thought we could do something in that area and then realized Kiva is a key player in the field.
We got a meeting with Jonny Price, from Kiva through Kiran Jain.

Basically we wanted to know why Kiva was not operating in Puerto Rico and if we could launch it there under Kiva.zip which is the pilot Kiva is running in the US and among other differences with Kiva.org loans don't have interest and Trustees have a different role.

Jonny had a clear answer: Nobody contacted me from Puerto Rico but we would love to launch there and since that moment we have been doing as much as we could to make it happen.

The smartest decision was to pitch Kiva to locals and made someone own this desire to launch it there.
We found that person pretty fast and she took it as a personal cruzade.

Meet Denisse Rodriguez, she works at Foundation for Puerto Rico and incorporated into her agenda the launch of Kiva in Puerto Rico. She is the champion in the island.

Denisse already pitched several potential trustees and 3 already are in the process of becoming legit.
Next step would be for those trustees to recommend borrowers and for us to reach out to Diaspora and promote the borrowers businesses.

This is Denisse pitching Kiva to Tara Rodriguez, from Departamento de la Comida, a hub for organic food.
