# Kiva Puerto Rico

We were suprised to find out that Puerto Rico has almost zero microloan initiatives. This struck us as an enormous opportunity to plant a seed of change.

Many business owners in Puerto Rico can't access credit from commercial banks however they still need financing to start and grow.

This is where microloan organizations come into play. When we contacted Jonny Price, Senior Director of Kiva Zip we found out that Kiva was simply never invited to operate on the island.

Immediately after meeting Jonny we set to work on getting Kiva launched in Puerto Rico. We found out that one possibility was to launch under Kiva.zip which is a pilot Kiva is running in the US.
The smartest decision was to pitch Kiva to locals and find someone own their own desire to launch it there. We were fortunate to find this person quickly and she took it as a personal crusade.

Denisse Rodriguez works at Foundation for Puerto Rico and incorporated into her agenda the launch of Kiva in Puerto Rico. She is the champion on the island for good causes and knows how to get things done.

Denisse has already pitched several potential trustees and 3 already are in the process of becoming official trustees. The next step is for those trustees to recommend borrowers and for us to reach out to the Puerto Rican diaspora and promote the borrower businesses.

This is Tara Rodriguez who will be one of the first three Kiva trustees in Puerto Rico. Tara runs "Departamento de la Comida", an organic food hub. She has regular contact with many farmers who may soon benefit from access to microloans via Kiva.
