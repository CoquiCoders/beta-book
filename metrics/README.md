# Metrics

One way for us to measure our effectiveness is looking at the existing amount of time currently spent by the users on either side of the problem space and then measuring the amount of time saved by using PrimerPeso.

# **Business owner**

##  **Time **


This is the current timeline for a business owner to apply for incentives:

| Current Context | |
| -- | -- |
| 10 days | researching online |
| 3 or more visits | agencies buildings |
| several phone calls| to government agencies |


And at the end of this there are no clear results.

**With PrimerPeso** it will take the business owner:


| With PrimerPeso |  |
| -- | -- |
| Less than 1 hour | researching online |
| 0 visits | agencies buildings |
| 0 phone calls | to government agencies |

In less than 1 hour the business owner knows which programs or incentives he/she is elegible for from the government of Puerto Rico.



## **Costs**

We also know that because of the existing state of information and processes - confusing and tangled - business owners will spend money to have a CPA guide them through the process. PrimerPeso was designed with these people in mind, because you shouldn't need to hire someone to navigate public information for you.

#**Employee**


**Nowadays** an employee spends:

1. Half of her/his time answering phone calls from uniformed business owners to run them through checklists of requirements. She/He has to check all available programs and recommend based on checklist. This is a manual process that does not have to be manual.

**With PrimerPeso** an employee will only spend:

1. less than half of their time answering phone calls from uniformed business owners. It will be  specifically from the non tech-savvy one.

**Nowadays** it costs:

1. 20 hours/week of an employee salary to run those programs

**With PrimerPeso** it will only cost:

1. less than 10 hour/week employee salary

##**Overall performance:**

1. We want to increase the number of applications for government incentive programs.

2. We want to evaluate programs and identify redundancies and duplications so that the government can make more efficient decisions.

3. We want to find gaps between offer and demand such as which municipalities or industries are being more active in the search phase. The end goal is to inform the governmentâ€™s economic development performance.
Stimulate  smart spending by reducing waste and making sur as government we put the money where people need it.

With the information provided by Primerpeso we can identify similar groups to perform studies:

1. One group that got the incentive
2. The other group with similar characteristics that got rejected

Evaluate performance of groups in terms of goals and outcomes.

Did they create more jobs?
Did they generate more money?
