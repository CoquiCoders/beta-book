# Areas

We divided our integration goals in three areas:

The **back-end**. We want to learn about the current government back-end systems that will handle the application process to make sure we will integrate it correctly and the app will survive in good shape after the fellowship. To do this we did research around the current CRMs used by agencies and proposed a solution that could be easily adopted by new agencies.


The **front-end**. We want to integrate our application within the government websites. This means either adding an iframe or banners.


The **promotion**. We are going to do a soft launch in August 28th in an event where Giancarlo Gonzalez, the CIO of the Governor, is going to present the results of the Tech Summit he hosted in June and introduce Primer Peso to the audience.
