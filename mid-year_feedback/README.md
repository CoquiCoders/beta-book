# Mid-year Accomplishments

June marks the middle of the calendar year and the two-thirds-passed point of our Code for America journey.

At this point our optimism reached new highs because we had developed strong position and made great progress.

1. The three of us had come together as a team.
2. We had established strong relationships with our collaborators in Puerto Rico.
3. Our research efforts paid off with critical insights and greater understanding.
4. We had launched a simple social story-telling platform "I Love Puerto Rico" which attracted local media attention, went viral and was forked and duplicated by other CfA teams for their cities.
5. The ideation process had generated multiple viable project options. We selected two of them: one with a smaller scope and one with a larger scope.
6. Both of our projects had been validated by our partners and customers and the specific details had become clear.
7. Our smaller-scope "quick win" project Negocio123 was already nearing completion.
8. Our larger-scope project PrimerPeso.com had begun full production design and programming.
