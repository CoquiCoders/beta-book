# Mid-year Feedback

June marks the middle of the calendar year and the two-thirds-passed point of our Code for America journey.

At this point our optimism reached new highs because we had developed strong position and made great progress towards our goals.

1. Our team had come together and we were able to successfully work and have fun as a team.
2. We had established strong relationships with our collaborators in Puerto Rico and maintained a continuous contact schedule.
2. The ideation and validation phases of the project were successful in generating a project that is desirable, feasible and viable.
