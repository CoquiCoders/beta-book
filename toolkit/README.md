# Toolkit


Many tools have been key to our process and we want to share with everyone our resources.

We made it a priority to use open-source tools.

###Documentation
We documented our **[Mid-Year Report**](http://chronicles.coquicoders.org/) with [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.io/), a free and opensource book editor. We also host our blog **[Coqui Coders**](http://coquicoders.org/) with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), a free, open-source, simple blogging platform.

We used [Slides.com](http://slides.com/) for every presentation we produced.  The Slides editor is available right in your browser. Unlike traditional presentation software, there's no need to download anything.

###Development
For the developing side we used node.js, Travis CI, Github, Angular, Postgres, and gulp.

###Communication & Sharing
To communicate with each other and with CfA fellows and staff we used [Slack](https://slack.com/), a real-time messaging, archiving and search for teams.

To communicate with the city partners we used [Google Hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts) for our weekly meetings and for team collaboration we used [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), a project management app.

We also used [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Cloudapp](http://www.getcloudapp.com) to share documents, slides, photos within our team and the rest of CfA.


###Design
For the design side we used for the landing page mock-up Sketch and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) frameworks and [Less.js](http://lesscss.org/usage) for the front-end UI.

To prototype we used [Photoshop](www.photoshop.com), [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/Illustrator), a simple sketchbook and [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)


###Research

For the research phase we used:

The video camera from the iphone to take photos of user testing sessions, workshops or interviews.

We used an audio recorder [Zoom H4](http://www.zoom.co.jp/products/h4n) to record all interviews and keep the audio for further analysis.

We had an old [Polaroid](www.polaroid.com) camera that we used to keep paper photos of Government employees and build an organigram.

We used [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/) to document ideas during the ideation process, together with [Post-its](www.post-it.com), whiteboards and sketchbooks.


###Expenses

For submitting our expenses we use [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com) which is the software CfA is using.
