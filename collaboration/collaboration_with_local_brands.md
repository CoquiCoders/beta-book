# Collaboration with Local Brands in August

We hosted a [workshop](http://coquicoders.org/the-business-journeys/) with [Brands of Puerto Rico](http://brandsofpuertorico.com/)- an ecommerce platform for local brands, and [Antrocket](http://www.antrocket.com/es)- a crowdfunding platform. Hosted at the co-working space [Serioulsy Creative](http://seriouslycreative.com/) in Santurce, Puerto Rico, the focus of the event was to learn more about the different journeys that small businesses take when seeking funding.

Each of these organizations is contributing in different ways to the creation and support of an ecosystem for small business owners.

### Photoshooting with local Brand for Landing page in August

We had the pleasure of participating in the photoshoot of [De Hojas](http://brandsofpuertorico.com/t/categories/health-beauty/de-hojas), a local home-made soap company. We featured De Hojas on our new landing launch page and they looked great!
