# Collaboration with Local Brands

We hosted a [workshop](http://coquicoders.org/the-business-journeys/) with [Brands of Puerto Rico](http://brandsofpuertorico.com/), an ecommerce platform for local brands and [Antrocket](http://www.antrocket.com/es), a crowdfunding platform. Hosted at the co-working space [Serioulsy Creative](http://seriouslycreative.com/) in Santurce, Puerto Rico, the focus of the event was to learn more about the different journeys that small businesses take when seeking funding.

Each of these organizations is contributing in different ways to the creation and support of an ecosystem for small business owners.
