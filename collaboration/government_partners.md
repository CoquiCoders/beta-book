# Aligning with Government Goals

Outside of our project's goals, our priority is to make sure that this fits in and works with the overall Economic Development agenda for Puerto Rico.

This means incorporating our solution into the government's **one-stop-shop initiative**

We understand that the government is planning to make one place for entrepreneurs to be able to sign on and access their information (**single sign-on**) and then expedite the business permitting process to be only **24 hours**.

With our app we then help them **find resources**, and assist with the **application process**. After applying the government will be responsible for making sure that **incentives are distributed** in a timely manner.

# Working with Government Partners

Multiple agencies in Puerto Rico have the mandate to improve Economic Development on the island. We have been fortunate in our efforts to build strong partnerships with these agencies, both in the course of our February research and throughout the year, especially after we had identified our project scope.

People in the agencies have helped us to identify the priority and validating our approach.

During our development it has been necessary to gather data about the incentive programs available in Puerto Rico. The people at the agencies have helped us by submitting their programs to our database in order to populate the results of our app's search. We have been working with CCE (Trade and Export Company of Puerto Rico), Economic Development Bank, Banco Popular, and PRIDCO (Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company) both with the upper levels of leadership as well as the ground-level employees that handle applications for small business support programs.
