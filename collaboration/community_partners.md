# Engaging with the community

One of the most enjoyable parts of our Puerto Rico Code for America Fellowhsip has been interacting with the community through the Code for America Brigade: [Code 4 Puerto Rico](http://code4puertorico.org)

In February we were present for the first official kick-off meeting, but it must be said that the Puerto Rico brigade was largely still functioning and all we had to do was show up, participate and share the Code for America love.

# Cultural Shifts

One beautiful change in our city that our brigade captain told us was that as a result of the brigade in San Juan many communities that once operated separately came together under the banner of the brigade. Active participants from the start-up community, the government, the entrepreneurial community, and just generally techy folks make up the San Juan brigade.

# Skill Shares

In February, we conducted a skillshare at [Piloto151](http://www.piloto151.com), the coworking space in Old San Juan which hosts all the Tuesday night brigade meetings.

Clara spoke about Lean Startup Methodologies and her experience in the startup world, Ainsley spoke about Rapid Prototyping with Twitter Bootstrap 3, and Max gave an overview of how git works and how to get started.

# Events

We have participated in and helped with several events put on by the brigade.

The first was **CodeAcross** on **February 22 - 23**. Over 80 people came during the course of the weekend which culminated with a hack day in Puerto Rico's Senate.

In April, we hosted a simultaneous **UnHackathon for Puerto Rico** in San Francisco and San Juan with 35 participants coming together to pitch apps that addressed issues on the island.

In May, the brigade put on the **National Day of Civic Hacking** event in Caguas, Puerto Rico where 40 people came to work on projects such as Caguas' LocalWiki and Puerto Rico Answers.

#Collaboration with Local Brands

We hosted a workshop with [Brands of Puerto Rico](http://brandsofpuertorico.com/), an ecommerce platform for local brands and [Antrocket](http://www.antrocket.com/es), a crowdfunding platform at co-working space [Serioulsy Creative](http://seriouslycreative.com/) in Santurce to learn more about the different journeys that small businesses take when seeking for funding.

We want to collaborate with each other by helping in the creation and support of an ecosystem for small business owners.
