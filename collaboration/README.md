# Collaboration

Code for America's is working towards a government by the people, for the people, that works in the 21st century. We want to help by connecting governments and their citizens to make cities, states, and territories better, more engaging places through the use of technology.

This year in Puerto Rico we have had the privilege of having fantastic experiences with both our government partners and our community partners.
