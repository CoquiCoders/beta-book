10.Tested and validated new name: Primer Peso


We divided our strategy in three areas:

The **back-end**. We wanted to learn about the current government back-end systems that will handle the application process to make sure we will integrate it correctly and the app will survive in good shape after the fellowship. To do this we did research around the current CRMs used by agencies and proposed a solution that could be easily adopted by new agencies.


The **front-end** part. We wanted to integrate our application within the government websites.


The **marketing** side of it. We are going to do a soft launch in August 28th in an event where Giancarlo is going to present the results of the Tech Summit he hosted in June.


This has been a long update but just like the rest of the Fellowship teams, there's a lot going on right now as we validate, develop, promote, and refine all at the same time.
