# More user testing and validation phase

During the two week trip to the island we accomplished a lot:

1. Performed user testing around the application with small business owners
2. Reach out to new agencies and got 6 new agencies onboard: Agriculture, OAJ, ADL, Film, Tourism and San Juan
3. Kickoff meeting with already onboard agencies
4. Performed workshop with Brands of Puerto Rico to gather insights about the the different businesses journeys around securing funding
5. Talked to some agencies about opening new datasets
6. Met and pitched application to small businesses organizations and associations
7. Schedules the launch of Kiva in Puerto Rico
8. Defined the integration with agencies CRMs or other systems
9. Discuss the launch in terms of branding and marketing
10.Tested and validated new name: Primer Peso


We divided our strategy in three areas:

The **technology** in place. We wanted to learn about the current government back-end systems that will handle the application process to make sure we will integrate it correctly and the app will survive in good shape after the fellowship. To do this we did research around the current CRMs used by agencies and proposed a solution that could be easily adopted by new agencies.


The **front-end** part of it. We wanted to integrate our application within the government websites.


The **marketing** side of it. We are going to do a soft launch in August 28th in an event where Giancarlo is going to present the results of the Tech Summit he hosted in June. During our user-testing sessions we collected information on the main channels small business owners use to learn more about government stuff and use those channels to communicate our value proposition.

We are working together with other local Brands and services to build an ecosystem that supports small businesses.

This has been a long update but just like the rest of the Fellowship teams, there's a lot going on right now as we validate, develop, promote, and refine all at the same time.
