We have been thinking a lot on how to reach out to small business owners.
Part of the workshop we did in Puerto Rico with small business owners was to collect the various journeys they transition when seeking for funding. These journeys will help us with stories, challenges,  channels and keywords that will be use for our launch campaign.
