# Branding

Together with the change in the layout we decided to change the name of the application.

What's in a name? The story behind PrimerPeso

Naming things is hard.

Giving a name to the project you’ve been working hard on all year carries extra weight.

In naming an app you have just a few syllables to communicate all the things you are trying to embody with your product: It has to be related to the subject matter, it has to convey energy, trustworthiness, and it’s good if the words have connotations that lend itself well to branding imagery.

Oh - and the domain name has to be available.

If you’ve been following this blog you may have noticed us calling our app a few different things over the course of the year.

There were dozens other proposed names that never saw the light of day. We've tried a lot.

Here’s a quick review of our naming journey:

**In late April our app was untitled**. We held a ‘namestorming’ session with several other fellows and got some great feedback and ideas to work with.

There were dozens other proposed names that never saw the light of day. We've tried a lot.

From there, **we compiled a huge list and chose 3 that we liked**. We wanted it to be business/funding/money related.
These were the name of our three prototypes that we took back to user test in May.

We threw one out right away based on user feedback, and stayed for a while with FundMe and BizWallet. We knew they weren’t ideal but didn’t have other good ideas and we had plenty of other things to work on. So we put it off and went with BizWallet for a while.

Forced by the deadline of our August trip to Puerto Rico, we returned to the subject. We knew we really had to choose a new name soon. We held a team brainstorming session and the top choices included “MoneyRocket, Tio Carlos, and StartLight” But none of these were names that all 3 of us could get excited about. We wanted to all love it.

We left for Puerto Rico undecided.

The first weekend we were there, there was a huge tropical storm warning. Our activities got cancelled, we were advised to stay inside and stock up on canned goods.

Max and Ainsley decided to go on a coffee and provisions run. The storm was brewing. We got lost coming back.

When we finally returned we found that Clara and Imanol had been brewing a storm of their own.

We walked in and they said “We have our new name. **How about PrimerPeso?**”

Imanol went on to explain how at his father’s restaurant, he had always kept the first dollar he made framed above the cash register. It was a symbol of good luck for the business’s future prosperity. The term carried a lot of meaning and positive connotation for Puerto Ricans, especially Puerto Rican business owners.

We loved it. It was alliterative, it was Puerto Rican, it conveyed the meaning of our app, it already sounded familiar and tested.

And, best of all - the domain name was available.

Clara got excited about the possibility of collecting stories around people’s Primer Pesos. Ainsley started seeing cute new logos with framed dollars. Max was excited that a decision was reached.

And we never looked back.

So that is the story how PrimerPeso was born in a Puerto Rican storm.

Together with the change in the name, we upgraded the logo.
