# A new name

Together with the change in the layout we decided to change the name for several reasons:

1. We wanted a name in spanish
2. We decided that BizWallet was giving the wrong message. Puertorican residents didn't really like it and we didn't love it either.

After several exercises and team discussions, we found one that we all liked - and we felt it was appropriate to have it in Spanish.

 **'Primer Peso'** is a phrase used in Puerto Rico to refer to your first client and it's a touchstone that all business owners can relate to. The phrase carries a connotation of luck and triumph over the struggles of setting up a business, as well as hope for the future of your business. These are all things that we consider and want to tap into with our application.

We tested and people in Puerto Rico liked it.
