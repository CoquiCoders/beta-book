# The layout

We decided to change quite a bit the layout because, on one hand, we were not satisfied and on the other, it was not telling the right story or engaging the audience.
We decided to try something new and test it during our trip to the island.

This was the old landing page:

We then built a landing page that we liked but was not addressing or engaging the Puertoricans. We received some comments on how it felt like an American Business Owner in contrast to a puertorican.

This was the new landing page:

We also received feedback around the story provided in the photo. Businesses commented: "Showcase an aspirational business owner"  We asked for aspirational stories and one that came as top of mind was about Hacienda San Pedro.

The story of **Hacienda San Pedro** goes all the way back to the end of the XIX century when a young Spaniard, thirteen years old, arrives on our shores with a single suitcase and a thousand dreams. Emeterio Atienza was an excellent worker, who, in a very short time, reached the position of head butler, and later,
Foreman of one of the most prestigious coffee plantations in Puerto Rico
Besides working the land by hand, Emeterio also worked as a teacher of agriculture, earning the respect of all the coffee growers in the region for his innate wisdom, perseverance and kind heart. In 1931, after many years of arduous work and constant dedication, Emeterio was finally able to purchase his own farm in the area of Coabey in the town of Jayuya, Puerto Rico and named it "Hacienda San Pedro". Every morning at dawn, Emeterio would go out on horseback, accompanied by his seven sons, to inspect the blooming of the coffee trees, carefully inspecting them one by one. Each tree had its own name, a tradition his son Albert carried on after him, as does to this day his grandson, Roberto Atienza.

This is what the landing page looked like after incorporating the image of Hacienda San Pedro:

During the trip in August we decided that we wanted to include a business owner in the landing we had built a connection with or that we could even meet before launching. It didn't feel like we could meet with Hacienda San Pedro owner before leaving.
We decided to partner with Brands of Puerto Rico, an ecommerce website that promotes local brands, and they suggested that we included De Hojas, a home-made soap company.

This is our current landing page with De Hojas and we love it.

We want to integrate the website with the existing government websites in Puerto Rico. This means either adding an iframe or a banner.
