# The layout

We were not satisfied with the landing page. We felt it was not telling the right story or engaging the audience in any way. We decided to try something new and tested in the trip to the island.

We first built this landing page and realized after speaking to our friends from the Brigade the photo was not addressing the Puerto Ricans. It was associated to an American Business Owner and we needed to change that.

The main request we had from our friends was to include an aspirational photo. We ask for stories and a recurrent one was around the story of Hacienda San Pedro.

The story of Hacienda San Pedro goes all the way back to the end of the XIX century when a young Spaniard, thirteen years old, arrives on our shores with a single suitcase and a thousand dreams. Emeterio Atienza was an excellent worker, who, in a very short time, reached the position of head butler, and later,
Foreman of one of the most prestigious coffee plantations in Puerto Rico
Besides working the land by hand, Emeterio also worked as a teacher of agriculture, earning the respect of all the coffee growers in the region for his innate wisdom, perseverance and kind heart. In 1931, after many years of arduous work and constant dedication, Emeterio was finally able to purchase his own farm in the area of Coabey in the town of Jayuya, Puerto Rico and named it "Hacienda San Pedro". Every morning at dawn, Emeterio would go out on horseback, accompanied by his seven sons, to inspect the blooming of the coffee trees, carefully inspecting them one by one. Each tree had its own name, a tradition his son Albert carried on after him, as does to this day his grandson, Roberto Atienza.
Honoring a family tradition that now embraces four generations of Atienzas, Hacienda San Pedro Coffee is still grown in the mountains of Jayuya, hand-picked, and lovingly brought to market the same way it was done nearly a century ago by Emeterio Atienza. Even today, the beans are dried in antique drums that are over a hundred years old.
Such is the love and respect that Roberto Atienza feels for his coffee that, during the critical hours while the coffee beans are drying, he spends night after night waiting next to the drums (just like his grandfather used to do) waiting for the exact moment when the coffee beans reach their perfect level of dryness. They say his ear is so finely tuned that, even while he is asleep, he automatically recognizes the precise pitch that tells him the coffee is dried to perfection. For Roberto Atienza, caring for the little details is his way of honoring and keeping alive his grandfather’s heartfelt dream of bringing to the world the finest coffee Puerto Rico Mountains can produce. Perhaps, it is for that same reason, the townspeople say that every once in a while, at the crack of the dawn, you can hear the clip-clop of horses trotting up Tres Picachos Hill and the echo of a faraway voice singing ever so merrily and they know in their hearts that there goes Emeterio, hard at work, proudly watching over his farm, just the way it’s always been.

This is what the landing page looked like after incorporating the feedback:

During our trip in August we decided that we should include a business owner in the landing we had a connection with or that we could even meet before. We decided to partner with Brands of Puerto Rico, an ecommerce website that promotes local brands, and they suggested to include De Hojas, two ladies working with home-made soaps.

This is our current landing page:
