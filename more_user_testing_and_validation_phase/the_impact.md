# The long-term impact

Incentives left on the table represent a lost opportunity when it comes to new businesses, jobs and community benefits. At a time when most local governments are under extreme scrutiny to increase jobs and reduce inefficiencies, we need to rethink our processes and increase local businesses.

Imagine a program that helps businesses find the funds they need, while reducing government administration and the cost to taxpayers.
We let entrepreneurs find and apply for a variety of government and non-government funding streams like reimbursements, tax credits and grants all in one place.
With Puerto Rico as the lead, we've built a new way to help small businesses, increase local jobs, and reduce red tape.
