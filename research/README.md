## The Landscape of Puerto Rico

We arrived to Puerto Rico with some ideas in mind and lots of expectations. The first barrier was the **language**. Even though mostly every citizen speaks English, the language you hear on the street and the language they use to approach you is mainly Spanish. Luckily we have one native speaker, but 67% of the coqui team barely knew enough to exchange pleasantries.

The second challenge was the **scope of the project**. Economic Development is by default a big challenge and you add complexity if you have these facts in mind:

**1. BIG DEBT**:
$70 Billion, downgraded to junk status the second day we were there.

**2. BRAIN DRAIN**:
3.7 million Puerto Ricans in mainland which recently surpassed the number of native puertorique√±os on the island.

**3. COMPLEX LEGAL SYSTEM**:
(Spain / US / PR)

**4. COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE**:
78 municipalities

We spent a lot of time understanding the context around Economic Development. Puerto Rico has a lot of agencies working under the umbrella of Economic Development and it was neccesary to understand how each agency worked on an individual level and as an overall structure.

It did not take long to pick up on the disconnect between agencies and the complexity of the situation in terms of roles, responsibilities and technology used.

However, one thing that made it all easier was the openess and willingness of the agencies employees.

**Many challenges, no regrets.**
