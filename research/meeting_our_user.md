# Building our User

As we honed our problem statement, we developed a **user persona** to focus our decision making about the product we would build.

###Main challenges (as told by our users):

**"I could not borrow money from the bank because MY credit was really bad"**


**"One of the things I know based on my experience is that you have to be properly capitalized. It means you have to have enough money to start"**


**"I didn't have the time to look for incentives and I knew it was going to be all this paperwork to file and I didnt have numbers to back it up."**
