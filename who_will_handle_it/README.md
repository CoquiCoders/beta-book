# Who will maintain it?

We spoke to Giancarlo Gonzalez, the CIO of Puerto Rico, about the sustainability concern. He is confident that his team at the **CIO office can handle the technology** side of it. He has a team of two developers with knowledge in node.js and other technologies we have used. He also wants to include and involve the Brigade.

The **Trade Company** will take responsability for:
1. the maintainance and update of programs.
2. point of contact for any new agency who wants to participate.
3. introdude the new agencies to the system.

Trade Company (CCE) is the main public corporation in Puerto Rico working with small businesses. It is the right agency in terms of product/market fit but also they were part of PrimerPeso from the beginning so they feela sense of ownership.
We are glad to work with these agencies and we are optimistic the project will be in good shape and good hands.

# How will they maintain it?

The CIO office will keep using Heroku for now until later on in the process where they will start using Azure Microsoft Hosting platform and will keep it running in the [Puerto Rico Github account](https://github.com/commonwealth-of-puerto-rico)

The Trade Company works with a vendor that keeps their website running. The vendor will be onboard for any inconvenience.
The communications person at the Trade Company will be the responsible for:

1. connecting with the existing agencies
2. reach out to new agencies
