# Inaccessible Incentives

### Business growth and economic development are integrally linked.

When businesses are successful that means jobs, a healthy cash flow in a community, and other fruits of economic growth. Puerto Rico knows this, and legislation at the state and municipal level is aimed at supporting businesses, primarily through the method of **incentives**.

Tax and economic incentives are numerous in Puerto Rico. They are crafted with the advice of economists, business leaders and industry experts with intelligent and clear goals.

Unfortunately, incentives are underutilized because they are **not effectively deployed**. In other words - if few are not using them, what good are they doing? **The good intentions of economic incentives often wind up dying on the vine.**


##Obstacles to Incentive Use:
**1. Users are not finding available incentives**

Small business owners are not sure where to look and typically they receive information about incentives through word of mouth, main government promoted initiatives, or an accountant.

**2. Choosing the right incentives**

They don't always have the tools to compare what's right for them based on their business model.

**3. Applying for incentives**

Applying for government programs has a bad reputation among business owners who have had painful experiences obtaining permits and paperwork necessary to take advantage of these programs.

**4. Delivery of incentives to recipients**

Even when the process is completed, documents are submitted, and the incentive is approved, many SME owners we spoke with were still waiting for the reimbursement or capital.


## Overall feeling towards process: Confusion and Uncertainty

But if incentives are already the main way that the government knows how to reach out to its citizens to support and develop the economy, it was clear to us that incentives and our mission of economic development were integrally linked. **The incentives  weren't the problem.** It's the knowledge-finding and delivery of the results that is the issue.
